# Importance-of-Effluent-Treatment-Plant-in-the-Textile-Industry
Wastewater management is one of the biggest issues in the industrial sector. With the rapid development of industries, more and more harmful contaminants are discharged into the environment which leads to serious environmental risk. Water pollution is among the major concerns of manufacturing industries like the textile industry. <br>

Hence it is obligatory for these industries to limit the hazardous wastewater discharged from the textile industry by setting up an effluent treatment plant. Effluent treatment plants or ETP are the most common and widely accepted approaches in achieving environmental safety. It is also the best option to keep the environment safe from textile waste, is cost-effective with excellent treatment efficiency. <br>

The Importance of ETP in Textile Industries <br>
The textile industry is the most water-consuming industry and also generates more wastewater as compared to other industries. Dyes and other chemicals in the wastewater are the main environmental concern for the textile industry. Excessive dye-laden water has a great impact on photosynthetic activity in aquatic plants and animals. It can also affect human health due to the presence of toxins like heavy metals and chlorines. <br>
To get rid of this problem an effluent treatment plant plays an important role in the textile and garment industries by protecting the environment from harmful wastewater. Effluent treatment plant manufacturers in India, help in setting up ET Plants that help industries like textile industries to purify wastewater before discharging it into the environment. These systems are conservative, efficient, and are designed to remove harmful substances from water. <br>

The Treatment Process of ETP in Textile Industries <br>
A combination of more than one treatment process is needed to remove all the contaminants. The untreated textile wastewater contains high levels of TSS, dyes, chemicals & auxiliaries, metal toxicants, and BOD that must be treated before they are discharged to the environment. When wastewater passes through ETP, the pollutants are removed and the quality of the water is improved to an acceptable level. Then the water can be discharged into the environment without any risk. <br>

Generally, the effluent treatment plant consists of four levels of treatment that are described below: <br>

**1. Preliminary Treatment** <br>
Also called the pretreatment stage, it involves a physical mechanism to treat wastewater. The purpose of this stage is the physical separation of big-sized impurities like cloth, paper, plastics, wood, and so on. <br>
The common physical unit operation at this level is: <br>
•	Screening: A screen with uniform-sized openings is used to remove large solids like plastics, cloths, etc. <br>
•	Sedimentation: A physical water treatment process is used to remove the suspended solids from the water. <br>
•	Clarification: This process helps in the separation of solids from fluids. <br>

**2. Primary Treatment** <br>
This involves the physical and chemical mechanisms for the treatment of wastewater. This stage removes the floating and settled materials like suspended solids and organic matter. Both chemical and physical processes are used in this process. <br>
Chemical processes use the addition of chemicals to the wastewater that brings about a change in its quality. ETP chemicals manufacturers provide chemicals that help in pH control, chemical coagulation, flocculation, chemical precipitation, and oxidation. <br>

**3. Secondary Treatment** <br>
The wastewater that enters into the secondary tank is free from any physical particles and uses a biological as well as chemical mechanism. The purpose of this stage is to remove or reduce the concentration of organic and inorganic compounds. <br> 
Most of the ETPs use biological treatments like aerated lagoons, activated sludge process, trickling filter, and oxidation pond to remove toxins. Among these, the activated sludge process is the most versatile biological oxidation method employed. <br>

**4. Tertiary Treatment** <br>
The last stage is the tertiary treatment that involves physical, chemical, and biological mechanisms to remove residual solids. The wastewater quality is improved and made fit for recycling, reuse, or safe discharge to the environment. <br>
This process removes the remaining inorganic compounds and substances like nitrogen and phosphorus.  Bacteria, viruses, and parasites that pose a threat to public health are also removed at this stage. Chemicals like Alum, chlorine is used to disinfect the water and make it fit for use. The remaining chlorine is removed by adding sodium bisulfate before its discharge. <br>

Thus, Effluent treatment plant greatly minimizes the damage done to the environment and also carries several benefits for the industry. The top five benefits of using an ETP from the best <a href="https://arvindkaigo.com/ETP-Chemicals.php">Effluent treatment plant manufacturers in India</a> are: <br>
•	It ensures that your factory is in compliance with environmental rules and regulations. <br>
•	It recycles wastewater and makes it fit for reuse. <br>
•	It is one of the best ways to reduce waste from your establishment. <br>
•	It removes unsafe pollutants and contaminants and is thus beneficial to the environment. <br>
•	A properly maintained ETP will help you save money in the long run. <br>
